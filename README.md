Project 2

Madison White

This project is a website allowing users to search for gifs.

I used HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

Although I did better making this website responsive than I did in Project 1, in the future I would like to improve even more to make it perfect.

I would also like to figure out how to fix my menu icon, I got stuck on this for a while & can't figure out what I did wrong.

My sidebar has a few quirks I would like to fix in the future.
